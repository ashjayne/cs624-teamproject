# Key features
Our shopping app includes a login feature, a product page, and a cart page. When the user clicks Add to Cart, the product adds to the shopping cart and a total is calculated.

# How the app works
The app imports product data through the API Fetch command and displays it within the app. The login and cart pages are managed by states.

# What learned
We learned how to create a cohesive app as part of a team and the order by which different parts of an application need to be created.
